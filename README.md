# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis: Unveiling Trends and Insights

This project highlights the application of Python in data analysis and showcases the power of data visualization in extracting insights from real-world datasets. Using Netflix's content catalog, we analyze trends in genres, ratings, durations, and regional contributions to learn and demonstrate key Python data science skills.

    ⚡ Built for learning: If you're exploring Python, Pandas, or Seaborn—this project is a hands-on example of turning raw data into insights.
